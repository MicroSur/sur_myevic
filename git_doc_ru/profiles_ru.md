### Profiles

You can switch between five different configuration profiles.  
A Profile stores all data relevant to vaping configuration; that is, vaping mode, coils resistance, preheat and algo settings, etc. Interface, display or others non vape-related settings are not reloaded when switching profiles.

To access the Profile selection screen, press and hold the Fire and (+) buttons for two seconds. On the Profile selection screen, select the profile and click Fire to activate it.

Each line display the Profile number, the selected mode and last used resistance.  
Empty lines correspond to empty profiles.  
By selecting an empty profile, the current profile will be duplicated.  
To duplicate current profile onto an existing profile (thus erasing it), select the target profile and press fire during two seconds. The target profile will be selected with a copy of the current profile.
